# Title Case (titlecase)

`titlecase` is a small tool and library (crate) that capitalizes English text
[according to a style][style] defined by John Gruber for post titles on his
website [Daring Fireball]. `titlecase` should run on all platforms supported
by Rust including Linux, macOS, FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, and Windows.

    curl https://releases.wezm.net/titlecase/3.0.0/titlecase-3.0.0-x86_64-unknown-linux-musl.tar.gz | tar zxf -

### From Source

If you have a stable [Rust compiler toolchain][rustup] installed you can
install the most recently released `titlecase` with cargo:

    cargo install titlecase

## Usage as a Rust Crate

**Minimum Supported Rust Version:** 1.70.0

See the [crate documentation][crate-docs].

## Building for WebAssembly

### Pre-requisites

- Rust 1.73.0+
- Rust `wasm32-unknown-unknown` target
  (`rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown` or `rust-wasm` package on Chimera Linux)
- [wasm-bindgen]
  (`wasm-bindgen` package on Arch, or `cargo install wasm-bindgen-cli --version 0.2.92`)
- `make` (GNU or BSD should work)

### Building

There is a `Makefile` that automates building for WebAssembly.

    make

The output is put into a `wasm` directory. See
<https://github.com/wezm/7bit.org/tree/main/public/titlecase> for an
example that uses the wasm build.

## Style

Instead of simply capitalizing each word `titlecase` does the following
([amongst other things][style]):

* Lower case small words like an, of, or in.
* Don't capitalize words like iPhone.
* Don't interfere with file paths, URLs, domains, and email addresses.
* Always capitalize the first and last words, even if they are small words
  or surrounded by quotes.
* Don't interfere with terms like "Q&A", or "AT&T".
* Capitalize small words after a colon.
